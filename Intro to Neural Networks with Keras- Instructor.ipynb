    "## What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks, or ANNs, are a family of computational models inspired by the brain which are used to approximate highly complex functions. A single neural network is composed of many highly interconnected processing elements (the nodes aka neurons) which each perform some basic computation on their inputs. Each neuron typically receives many inputs from other neurons in the network, and outputs a nonlinear function of the sum of its weighted inputs. The output from this neuron is then passed through the network as input to the next set of neurons. In this way, the neural network \"deconstructs\" and parallelizes its inputs, and then \"reconstructs\" a target state or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of neural networks, each of which has its own connectivity and dynamics, however all neural networks share the concept of training by modifying its connection weights. It is by manipulating these weights that the neural network learns to reconstruct the desired targets in the case of supervised learning, or an efficient compression of its inputs in the case of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll take a look at one of the simplest neural networks: the multilayer perceptron (MLP), also known as the feedforward neural network."

    "Shown above is a simple multilayer perceptron. In this diagram, each of the circles represents a node, or neuron, in the network. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer of neurons (except the first layer, which receives the raw input), computes a nonlinear function on the sum of its inputs, and sends its output to the next layer of neurons. Notice that there are no arrows between neurons within a layer, or going backwards between layers. For this reason, MLPs are also known as \"feedforward\" networks to distinguish them with \"recurrent\" networks, which have much more complex dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network above has three layers; the first layer is called the input layer, the second layer is known as the hidden layer, and the last layer is called the output layer. MLPs can have any number of hidden layers, but always have one input and one output layer. Each layer can be composed of any number of neurons, provided there are no connections within a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the network is first initialized, random weights are assigned to the connections between the individual neurons. When the network is given an input, it uses those random connection weights to pass the activity forward one layer at a time, eventually reaching the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the activity reaches the output layer, the activity in the output layer is compared with a set of target values (thus the MLP is a supervised learning algorithm). These error values are then used to change the weights of the connections such that the error is reduced by a small amount. Over time, the error is minimized more and more until the network begins to correctly classify its input."

    "### Create Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a Sequential model and add layers one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of inputs. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input_dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know the number of layers and their types?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem if that helps at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers to create a multilayer perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are defined using the Dense class. We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument, the initialization method as the second argument as init and specify the activation function using the activation argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we initialize the network weights to a small random number generated from a uniform distribution (‘uniform‘), in this case between 0 and 0.05 because that is the default uniform weight initialization in Keras. Another traditional alternative would be ‘normal’ for small random numbers generated from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the rectifier (‘relu‘) activation function on the first two layers and the sigmoid function in the output layer. It used to be the case that sigmoid and tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is achieved using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can piece it all together by adding each layer. The first layer has 12 neurons and expects 8 input variables. The second hidden layer has 8 neurons and finally, the output layer has 1 neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)."

The backend automatically chooses the best way to represent the network for training and making predictions to run on your hardware, such as CPU or GPU or even distributed.\n",
